		<li>Cats can be lethal hunters and very sneaky, when they walk their back paws step almost exactly in the same place as the front paws did beforehand, this keeps noise to a minimum and limits visible tracks. </li>

		<li>Cats have powerful night vision, allowing them to see at light levels six times lower than what a human needs in order to see. </li>

		<li>Cats also have excellent hearing and a powerful sense of smell. </li>

		<li>Older cats can at times act aggressively towards kittens. </li>

		<li>Domestic cats love to play, this is especially true with kittens who love to chase toys and play fight. Play fighting among kittens may be a way for them to practice and learn skills for hunting and fighting. </li>

		<li>On average cats live for around 12 to 15 years. </li>
		</ul>
